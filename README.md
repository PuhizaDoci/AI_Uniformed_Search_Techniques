  1.  The algorithm that implements and solves the Sudoku puzzle with Graph Coloring having BFS and DFS both implemented and using backtracking.
    In order to execute this python script, change the directory to the 'Sudoku_Graph_Coloring' folder and execute 'py main.py'. 
  2.  The script that solves the Sudoku puzzle using Graph Coloring with DFS and backtracking fully for further understaing.
    In order to execute this python script, change the directory to the 'Sudoku_Graph_Coloring_Backtracking' folder and execute 'py sudoku_solver.py'. The solution of  the puzzle will appear in a file called 'solution.txt' in this same directory.
